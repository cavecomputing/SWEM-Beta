### Submitting a bug report
*Note: Do NOT contact a volunteer directly about bugs*   

Issue tracking will be handled via this Github repo. You will need to create a Github account in order to submit issues.  

* At the top of the page is a tab labeled `Issues`. 
  This will be the primary location to submit any and all bug reports  
* You can see the current bugs being tracked and via a green button at the top right that says `New Issue`, you can create a new issue  
 
**Prior to submitting a bug report, please make sure there is not an existing bug report that already details your problem**.  

#### Prior to submitting a bug report you MUST test the mod by itself with NO OTHER MODS in a singleplayer world to determine if it is an issue with SWEM or with the other mod.
